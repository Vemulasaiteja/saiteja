            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <p>Hello..!My self i am vemula sai teja, I stay in hyderabad, and i am fresher and As a fresh graduate, I understand the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the  latest industry trends. I am committed to enhancing my knowledge and expertise in emerging technologies.
                Firstly,I don't even know what coding means.When i try to learn,i got to know what coding means and my journey of coding started from a youtube when i saw one coding tutorial video i saw some of key points in that and i justed noted it,I started learning coding from <b>HTML</b>and <b>CSS</b> CSS was very interesting topic i saw some many videos of html from youtube and tried to do it by myself,then i saw i made some of errors(mistakes).Then i realized that as i am a fresher with zero knowledge of coding, mentor is important for me.When i got to know the actual concept of  coding.First time when i did my project i got a confidence that i can crack it.And now i know the concepts of <b>Java</b>,<b>Javascript </b>and <b>Phython</b></p>
            <p class="para2">I did some projects on the languages and i boosted-up like rocket and i got enthusiasm on coding.One main point to remember is a week of not coding may destroy one year of experiance. By these point i knew that in coding practicing play's a major role.So i started practicing, and every programmer should need to be adaptable for new technologies accordingly,As a programmer every one should need to be keep on learning,When we a proper knowledge on logics we can easily do everything <mark>understanding logic's</mark> is very important.
            Now i have Strong base on programming as i made some projects on languages,i got the perfect roadmap to learn any new technologies.</p>
